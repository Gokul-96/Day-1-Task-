Day 1 Task:

1. Difference between HTTP1 and HTTP2?

HTTP used for interaction between client and server sides. Here mainly focusing two stages 1. HTTP1.1 and 2.HTTP2.0

HTTP1.1 :
Client has send request to server and server respond back as per the request. In single connection we can send and receive several request and response like persistent connection.
Drawback of HTTP1.1 It transfer all the requests and the responses in plain text message and head of line blocking in which
TCP connection is blocked all other requests until the response does not receive. It compress by itself and uses requests 
resource Inlining for use getting multiple pages.

HTTP2.0 :
It transform all request and response in binary format and uses SPDY protocol. It works on fully multiplexed.
(one TCP connection required multiple request)
For data compression it use HPACK and uses PUSH frame by server collects all multiple pages.


HTTP/1.1
    -It works on textual format.
    -It compresses data by itself


HTTP/2
    -It works on binary protocol
    -It uses HPACK for data compression



2. objects and its internal representation in Javascript:

Objects contain any combination of primitive data type like Number, String, Boolean, null, undefined and symbol. It is unordered collection of data in the form of key:value pairs. These keys can be variables or functions and are called properties and methods.

Syntax for adding a property to an object,
ObjectName.ObjectProperty = propertyValue

Both the object name and property name are case sensitive. You can define a property by assigning it a value.
E.g: var myBike =new Object();
myBike.color =”Black”;
 
And unassigned properties of an object are undefined myBike.color;

Properties of JavaScript objects can also be accessed or set using a bracket notation.

myBike[“color”]= “Black”

One of the way to create object is Key:value pairs,

Let details ={name: “gokul”, age : “28”}

Constructor is used for creating class variable

this. Keyword used for accessing object variable.
